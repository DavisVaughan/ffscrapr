# fantasyscrapr
*An R Interface for Fantasy League APIs*

This package abstracts some of the code used to build a league analyzer, with the goal of making it easier for R developers to access various fantasy (football?) APIs. The final vision for this package is to have one function to be called and then translated into the appropriate code for the platform - i.e. "get_rosters()" would know how to respond for MFL, Sleeper, ESPN, Yahoo etc. 

## Installation

Install from GitHub with:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools") OR install.packages("remotes") ## remotes is a subpackage of devtools
